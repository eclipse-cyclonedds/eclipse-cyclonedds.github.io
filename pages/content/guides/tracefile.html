        <h2 id="how-to-read-the-cyclone-dds-trace-file">How to read the Cyclone DDS trace file</h2>
<p>The "canonical" trace of Cyclone DDS is enabled by setting <code>Tracing/Category</code> to <code>trace</code> or <code>Tracing/Verbosity</code> to <code>finest</code>, the two really amount to the same thing because the verbosity settings expand to predefined sets of categories, and <code>finest</code> expands to <code>trace</code>. It usually contains far too much data and yet often still misses the bits that one is really looking for. This is quite simply the trouble with logging in general. The interpretation of this output of this logging setting is what this document tries to help with.</p>
<p>A general familiarity with the protocol is assumed, a slightly careless (sic!) reading of the <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS">specification</a> should provide you with that. Reading it "slightly carelessly" works better than a detailed reading, because the former will give you a good overview of how it works, while the latter will raise more questions than it answers and besides leads you into the lovely land of underspecifications and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Choosing a less verbose tracing mode simply means some data gets omitted. Therefore, knowing how to make sense of the canonical tracing mode output will also help make sense of the less verbose modes. There are also additional tracing categories that can be enabled, those are use rarely and don’t significantly disturb the interpretation of the normal modes. </p>
<p>There are some general conventions that are described first, what then follows is a number of excerpts with some explanation.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have <code>less</code> available, that's what I would suggest using for perusing these traces. It is certainly possible that other tools support this as well or better, but I haven't found them yet.</p>
<h3 id="general-conventions">General conventions</h3>
<p>The trace consists of roughly the following groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>the configuration options</li>
<li>initialisation of the network stack</li>
<li>liveliness monitoring and resource usage information</li>
<li>construction of built-in topic support (this simply happens first)</li>
<li>normal operation</li>
<li>shutdown</li>
</ul>
<p>During normal operation, there is the creation/deletion of entities, discovery work, flow of data and all the control messages, as well as various events related to all of that. If thread liveliness monitoring is enabled, there is also periodic tracing of thread states.</p>
<p>The trace is a sequence of lines, with per-thread line buffering for balancing between logging what happens concurrently and keeping some order. Each line has a standard prefix:</p>
<ul>
<li>time stamp (added just before appending the line to the file)</li>
<li>domain id</li>
<li>the (truncated) thread name, or a thread id if no name is available</li>
</ul>
<p>After this follows free-form text. Generally this document will refer to that free-form text when it mentions “the line ...” and simply ignore the existence of the standard prefix.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration is dumped at the very beginning, each line starting with “config:”, then giving the XML element/attribute and its value (these are quite obvious), and then a less-obvious bit between braces at the end of each line. For example, with</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>CYCLONEDDS_URI=&lt;Gen&gt;&lt;Net&gt;lo0&lt;/Net&gt;&lt;/Gen&gt;,&lt;Disc&gt;&lt;Part&gt;auto&lt;/&gt;,&lt;Tr&gt;&lt;C&gt;trace&lt;/&gt;,&lt;Disc&gt;&lt;Part&gt;none&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>it gives:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633098067.140170 [0]    1653091: config: Domain/General/NetworkInterfaceAddress/#text: lo0 {0}
1633098067.140340 [0]    1653091: config: Domain/General/MulticastRecvNetworkInterfaceAddresses/#text: preferred {}
1633098067.140354 [0]    1653091: config: Domain/General/ExternalNetworkAddress/#text: auto {}
...
1633098067.140574 [0]    1653091: config: Domain/Discovery/ParticipantIndex/#text: none {1,3}
...
1633098067.140690 [0]    1653091: config: Domain/Tracing/Category/#text: trace {2}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The numbers between the braces list the configuration fragments that contained a value for the setting. An empty pair (<code>{}</code>, like for <code>ExternalNetworkAddress</code>) here thus means it is at the default. The <code>lo0</code> setting for <code>NetworkInterfaceAddress</code> comes from the first fragment, the <code>ParticipantIndex</code> was set in the 2nd fragment and then overridden in the 4th fragment and the tracing category was set in the 3rd fragment. In most cases, there’s only one source of settings and it really isn’t interesting; if there are more than 32 sources, it’ll only list the first 32.</p>
<h3 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h3>
<p>Immediately following the configuration it traces the actual starting time stamp:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633098067.142632 [0]    1653091: started at 1633098067.06141453 -- 2021-10-01 16:21:07+02:00
</code></pre></div>

<p>and the waking up of the network stack, which really starts with enumerating the interfaces:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633098067.143183 [0]    1653091: interfaces: lo0 udp/127.0.0.1(q1) en0 wireless udp/192.168.1.9(q9)
1633098067.143210 [0]    1653091: selected interfaces: lo0 (index 1)
1633098067.143215 [0]    1653091: presumed robust multicast support, use for everything
</code></pre></div>

<p>The interface list gives the names, IP address, the type of network interface and a magic “quality” indication. The highest quality is what it uses by default; if there are multiple at that time, it picks an “arbitrary” one, which really happens to be first. Loopback get a low number, multicast-capable ones a high one.</p>
<p>It then lists the interface(s) it will use, which include the interface “index” that later shows up in all kinds of settings where the internal representation of a locator is printed (e.g., in <code>udp/127.0.0.1:51437@1</code>, the <code>@1</code> refers to the interface index).</p>
<p>If the network supports multicast, it looks at the type of adapter to decide how reliable the multicast is on this network. A WiFi network is considered to provide “flaky” multicast good enough for initial discovery but not much else, while other network interfaces (e.g., wired networks and loopback interfaces) are presumed to have “robust” multicast. This information is used to select the mode when <code>General/AllowMulticast</code> is at the default setting of <code>default</code>.</p>
<p>Then follows a relatively self-explanatory bit about sockets, port numbers, addresses, joining multicast groups, and the starting of threads. At this point it also sets up the built-in topic support.</p>
<h3 id="liveliness-monitoring-and-resource-usage">Liveliness monitoring and resource usage</h3>
<p>This just starts at some point, shortly after the various threads get started. It consists of two kinds of lines, one a thread reporting how much CPU time it has consumed so far:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633099505.905137 [0]        tev: thread_cputime 0.000034000
1633099505.905251 [0]     recvMC: thread_cputime 0.000036000
</code></pre></div>

<p>The other is a periodic report from the thread liveliness monitoring thread that is created if enabled by the <code>Internal/LivelinessMonitoring</code> setting:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633099636.659744 [0]  threadmon:  0(1663713):a:3f0-&gt;420 1(gc):a:210-&gt;230 2(dq.builtins):a:40-&gt;40 3(dq.user):a:0-&gt;0 5(tev):a:70-&gt;70 6(recv):a:80-&gt;80 7(recvMC):a:0-&gt;0 8(recvUC):a:0-&gt;0 9(ping):a:130-&gt;160 10(pong):a:70-&gt;80: OK
1633099636.659829 [0]  threadmon: rusage: utime 0.035621000 stime 0.052603000 maxrss 49676288 data 0 vcsw 7 ivcsw 157
</code></pre></div>

<p>The second line is standard <code>getrusage</code> data: user and system time, maximum RSS size and amount of private memory, and voluntary and involuntary context switches. The first line lists all of the known threads for this domain, whether they are alive or dead and the virtual clock. “OK” at the end means all threads made the expected progress. If it transitions from OK to not-OK and the additionally the <code>Internal/LivelinessMonitoring[@StackTraces]</code> setting is enabled (it is by default), it’ll dump stack traces for all these threads to the log.</p>
<p>The details of what constitutes progress and the exact meaning of all these numbers is outside the scope of this document.</p>
<h3 id="built-in-topic-support">Built-in topic support</h3>
<p>This is really just the creation of some special writers (this is just one of them):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633098563.672793 [0]    1656550: new_local_orphan_writer(DCPSParticipant/org::eclipse::cyclonedds::builtin::DCPSParticipant)

</code></pre></div>

<p>The “orphan” in <code>new_local_orphan_writer</code> is because these writers are not attached to any DomainParticipant, nor to a Publisher entity. They just exist without having a parent. “Orphan” doesn’t quite capture the notion of something that never had a parent to begin with, but it is close enough.</p>
<p>In this: <code>DCPSParticipant/org::eclipse::cyclonedds::builtin::DCPSParticipant</code> is the topic name and the type name. The next line is related to type discovery, which this document ignores (for now, anyway).</p>
<p>The line starting with <code>WRITER</code>, like <em>all</em> lines starting with <code>WRITER</code>, denotes the creation of a local DDSI-level writer entity. These typically are advertised on the wire, but the orphan ones are not. These lines give the GUID and the QoS settings with all the booleans, enumerated types and durations values as their numerical value. For example, “history=0:1” means a history kind = 0 = KEEP_LAST, history depth = 1. The magic number 9223372036854775807 = 2^63-1 represents infinity. Thus, given a trace, it is straightforward to find out all the QoS settings involved.</p>
<p>Finally <code>match_writer_with_readers</code> is where it tries to match it with readers, but this early in the start up sequence, there cannot be any readers.</p>
<h3 id="regular-operation">Regular operation</h3>
<p>Regular operation covers pretty much everything that follows. This can be subdivided in a number of different kinds of activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>participant creation/deletion</li>
<li>topic creation/deletion</li>
<li>reader/writer creation/deletion</li>
<li>discovery of the above from remote participants</li>
<li>transmitting application data</li>
<li>receiving application data</li>
<li>operation of the reliable protocol</li>
<li>(and possibly some more)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the work is split between:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive threads (starting with <code>recv</code>)</li>
<li>timed-event handling (starting with <code>tev</code>)</li>
<li>delivery-queue threads (starting with <code>dq.</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A receive thread handles input from one or more sockets. It traces the received packets in a decoded form, performs all protocol processing and either delivers the data directly or hands it off to a delivery queue for further processing. All built-in/discovery data is handled by <code>dq.builtin</code>.</p>
<p>For each received message, the header and all individual submessages are traced, with the submessage names in capitals, e.g.:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633275476.905567 [0]     recvUC: HDR(110b5a6:26340b11:62ec0f10 vendor 1.16) len 64 from udp/127.0.0.1:59598

<p>This is the receipt of two separate packets, one consisting of an RTPS message header, an INFODST submessage and an ACKNACK one; the other consisting of a header, an INFOTS and DATA submessage carrying an application sample with its source timestamp, and finally a piggy-packed HEARTBEAT message.</p>
<p>The format of each submessage is roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HDR</code>: RTPS message header with source GUID prefix, vendor code, packet length and source address</li>
<li><code>INFODST</code>: destination GUID prefix</li>
<li><code>INFOTS</code>: timestamp</li>
<li><code>DATA</code>, <code>DATAFRAG</code>: writer GUID, reader GUID, sequence number (in the case of a datafrag: extended with the range of fragment numbers in the submessage). If receiving this submessage results in delivering data, some additional output follows</li>
<li><code>GAP</code>: similar to <code>DATA</code> as it encodes the absence of data</li>
<li><code>ACKNACK</code>:<ul>
<li><code>F</code>: final flag set</li>
<li><code>#2</code>: ACKNACK "count" field</li>
<li><code>14/0:</code> "bitmap base" (i.e., it acks sequence numbers &lt; 14 in this case), length and bitmap following the colon</li>
<li>reader GUID <code>-&gt;</code> writer GUID</li>
<li>followed by some interpretation: retransmits, how many additional message have been acknowledged, how many were dropped form the WHC, some flags</li>
<li>pre-emptive ACKNACKs are published with count = 0, bitmap base = 1 and bitmap length = 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>HEARTBEAT</code>:<ul>
<li><code>F</code>: final flag set</li>
<li><code>#2</code>: HEARTBEAT "count" field</li>
<li><code>a..b</code>: oldest sequence number available in WHC, highest sequence number published; b = a-1 is used to indicate an empty one</li>
<li>followed by how it treats this for the matching readers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>NACKFRAG</code>, <code>HEARTBEATFRAG</code>: similar to <code>ACKNACK</code> and <code>HEARTBEAT</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For all of these, if a GUID is unknown, it appends <code>?</code> to the GUID and ignores the message. In some cases it will ignore messages from known GUIDs, in which case the GUID is in brackets.</p>
<h4 id="participant-creationdeletion">Participant creation/deletion</h4>
<p>There is not all that much specifically for creating the participant:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633099629.586785 [0]    1663713: PARTICIPANT 110d959:b723e9bf:b981aa83:1c1 QOS={user_data=31&lt;&quot;DDSPerf:0:54744:phantasie.local&quot;&gt;,adlink_entity_factory=0}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The bulk of the output generated when creating a participant is actually the creation of readers/writers for the built-in endpoints implementing the “simple endpoint discovery protocol” (SEDP) used to advertise this participant and its endpoints to remote participants and to discover remote endpoints. Depending on the configuration settings some or all of these may be omitted.</p>
<p>The built-in endpoints all have fixed entity ids, defined by the spec. The tracing for creating these writers is pretty much the same as it is for the “orphan” writers for locally publishing discovery data, described above. Naturally, there is an owning participant and some bookkeeping output because of that. At the time a participant is created, participants may have been discovered already and the “match_...” lines may result in matching the local endpoints with remote ones.</p>

<p>The discovery data is all sent via the message queue handled by the <code>tev</code> thread, and around 400 bytes is fairly typical for an SPDP message.  The <code>nn_xpack_send</code> line is the point where it actually passes a datagram to the network, it enumerates the addresses it gets sent to between the square brackets (it also tends to not use square brackets for anything else, so searching for <code>\[ [^]]</code> is a way of quickly finding points where data is actually sent out).</p>
<p>From then on, the SPDP message is resent periodically:</p>

<p>What follows is tearing down the discovery endpoints. It simply tries to delete all possibly existing built-in endpoints, regardless of whether they actually exist. For example, if DDS Security is not used, various endpoints don't exist, and these show up in the trace as:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633099642.807321 [0]         gc: delete_writer_nolinger(guid 110d959:b723e9bf:b981aa83:ff0003c2) - unknown guid

<p>this is harmless.</p>

<p>TBD</p>
<h4 id="readerwriter-creationdeletion">Reader/writer creation/deletion</h4>
<p>Readers and writers are handled analogously. While there are some differences they can mostly both be simply considered as <em>endpoints</em>. One notable difference is that a writer can have unacknowledged data in its writer history cache when the application tries to delete it, In that case, the <code>LingerDuration</code> setting applies. This shows up in the trace as some additional state transitions.</p>
<p>For example, the creation of a reader for a built-in topic (<code>DCPSPublication</code> in this case): these are a bit special in that they never match a remote writer, but they do always match an existing writer:</p>

<p>The <code>match_reader_with_proxy_writers</code> fails to find any remote writers (necessarily, because this is a built-in topic); the <code>match_reader_with_writers</code> for one of these built-in topics invariably finds the correspond orphan writer created at the very beginning.

<p>It adds the publication of the SEDP message to inform the peers of the existence of the new endpoint. This then gets pushed out to all readers via the <code>tev</code> thread, much like the SPDP messages. However, where the SPDP messages are always sent regardless of the existence of readers, the SEDP messages are only sent if there are matching readers. In the trace I used, there weren't any at this point in time. SEDP uses transient-local endpoints and the message here is stored in the writer history cache and will be regurgitated when a remote reader requests it. This uses the same mechanisms as regular reliable communication (i.e., <code>HEARTBEAT</code> and <code>ACKNACK</code> messages).</p>
<h4 id="participant-discovery">Participant discovery</h4>
<p>Received SPDP messages are queued for processing by the <code>dq.builtins</code> thread, which then either updates an existing "proxy participant" entity for that GUID, or it creates a new one. E.g. receipt of the message on one of the receive threads:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>xpack_addmsg</code> and <code>nn_xpack_send</code> are the same as elsewhere, it is simply constructing a message and sending it out. The <code>writer_hbcontrol</code> line concerns updating the writer heartbeat state, and in this case decides to "multicast" a heartbeat to all readers (whether it actually is a multicast at the network level is a separate matter). That heartbeat is piggybacked onto the DATA submessage. An asynchronous heartbeat publication is rescheduled to occur in about 100ms, but it may never be sent if the acknowledgements come in first (or turns out to be unnecessary because of some other reasons).</p>
<p>The parenthesized bits give some information on the state: the number of reliable proxy readers, the number of those that have caught up with the writer (having just published a sample, none of them have) the latest sequence number in the writer and the highest acknowledged sequence number. The <code>!</code> in the <code>heartbeat</code> line here indicates some proxy readers have yet sent an acknowledgement yet at all.</p>
<h4 id="receiving-application-data">Receiving application data</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, any time a <code>DATA</code>, <code>DATAFRAG</code>, <code>GAP</code> or <code>HEARTBEAT</code> message arrives that makes some samples available for delivery, this samples are appended to the log in lines similar to:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>1633275476.905759 [0]     recvUC: data(application, vendor 1.16): 110b5a6:26340b11:62ec0f10:1102 #1: ST0 DDSPerfRPongKS/KeyedSeq:{13,0,{}})
</code></pre></div>

<p>this may be done by the receive thread that received the message or it may be done asynchronously by one of the <code>dq...</code> threads draining a delivery queue.</p>
<h4 id="reliable-protocol">Reliable protocol</h4>
<p>The DDSI reliable protocol operates by periodically sending <code>HEARTBEAT</code> messages from writers to readers, informing the latter of the range of available sequence numbers. In this implementation, these are in principle only sent when the writer history cache contains unacknowledged data. (There are some other cases in which they do get sent.) If the heartbeat requests a response (no "final" flag set), the readers are expected to promptly respond, else they may respond but need not. A reader is not allowed to spontaneously send acknowledgements, other than "pre-emptive" ones for establishing a reliable channel.</p>
<p>The acknowledgement message (ACKNACK) acknowledges all data up to, but not including, the sequence number in the message, and furthermore indicates missing samples by setting bits in a variable-length bitmap. If a bit is set, a retransmit is requested for the sample with the sequence number corresponding to that bit. If instead it is clear, nothing is reported on that sample: it may or may not have been received, and it is even allowed to state that nothing is known about a sample that hasn't even been published yet (there are some implementors that apparently didn't understand that detail). Once a sample has been acknowledged there's no going back, short of lease expiry and rediscovery.</p>
<p>A typical happy day scenario for receiving data for a low-rate writer works out as follows (don't mind the GUIDs, this is not from a matched pair of log files). The writer packs a sample and possibly (for a low-rate writer, typically) a heartbeat into an a single RTPS message / UDP datagram, and sends this:</p>

<p>Two things are interesting here is that the message currently being constructed is typically pushed by a failure to add another sample. That sample then immediately gets appened to a new message and a heartbeat is piggy-backed into that new message. After that many more samples get added and the cycle repeats. Squeezing a heartbeat into most every message ensures that at high data rates, recovery from lost messages is possible without waiting for a timer to expire.</p>
<p>When samples are lost the reader sends an ACKNACK which then causes the writer to schedule retransmissions (assuming the data is still available):</p>

<p>The <code>RXn</code> stands for retransmit sequence number n; it can also trace <code>RXn (merged)</code> which means it is <em>assumed</em> to have been taken care of by a retransmit that immediately preceded it. Another possibility is <code>Mn</code> which stands for "missing" sequence number n, and invariable results in a GAP. The <code>rexmit#</code> then gives the number of retransmitted samples, the remainder is the maximum sequence number in the reply, the highest sequence number transmitted by the writer and the highest sequence number published by it (which is not necessarily the same).</p>
