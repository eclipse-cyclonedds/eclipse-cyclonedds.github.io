<p>Deeply hidden in Cyclone's Github, there's a wealth of information and explanations on the inner-workings of Cyclone DDS.
Below you'll find an overview of these <em>DEEP DIVE</em> topics that both extend as well as typically exceed a regular FAQ.</p>
<p>Often these topics are work-in-progress where the 'remarks' section will provide some details and/or questions</p>
<h4 id="topic-on-handling-user-data-and-its-relationship-with-built-in-topics">TOPIC: on handling user-data and its relationship with built-in-topics</h4>

<li>an evolving topic also w.r.t. completeness and representation of built-in topic support (including suggested API's for getting discovered remote-entity data similar to get_discovered_participant/get_matched_publication_data)</li>
<li>also a discussion on OMG vs. Cyclone DDS (C-)API and their respective usability</li>

<ul>
<li>Q: is there a plan/timeline to exploit (wire-level) in-line QoS to (at least) support (interoperable) writer-side QoS-changes ?</li>
<li>Q: are non-RxO (including user_data) and 'partition' QoS-changes 'at runtime' allowed already (as suggested on ticket #63)(as it would imply processing new SPDP/SEDP discovery messages) ?</li>
<li>Q: was there any progress for specifically the <em>user_data</em> w.r.t. a proper implementation where the <em>user data</em> part of the QoS struct in the participant can be updated ?</li>

<h5 id="reference-cycloneddsissues104">reference: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/issues/104">cyclonedds/issues/104</a></h5>
<h5 id="remarks_4">remarks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>a still worthwhile topic to be mentioned/discussed </li>
<li>also noting that having to set 'internal' configurations such as a 'AssumeMulticastCapable' interface-list is perhaps less than ideal..</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="reference-cycloneddsissues119">reference: <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/issues/119">cyclonedds/issues/119</a></h5>
<h5 id="remarks_5">remarks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>explains how the WHC plays a role in the transient_local behavior of discovering bilt-in readers/writers .. esp as typically (for <em>normal</em> writers) sizing of non-volatile cash is 'independent' from an actual WHC and is drivern by the topic-level QoS</li>
<li>also a nice explanation on how heartbeat-data conveys the availability of such non-volatile data to a (starting)reader so it can request data regardless of how the connection came to existence</li>
<li>and furthermore explains how to recognize/interpret a set of tracing messages related to configuration-used, SPDP data, port-pairs associated with discovered participants, GUIDS that indicate looped-back data, etc.) including an actual log-assessment</li>
<li>interesting aspect here is that an issue was identified, likely on some embedded platform that exposed rather strange/unexplained behavior but where some suggestions for further analysis weren't followed-up</li>
<li>Note that also <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds/issues/337">cyclonedds/issues/337</a> addresses some of the mechanics about what 'historical data' in a writer is available (as well as 'advertised' in its '<em>firstSN</em>' heartbeat section )</li>
<li>Note that this also opened a discussion on spec-ambiguities w.r.t. what available (historical/durable) data to advertise where Cyclone basically <em>implements a 3-way handshake like TCP does</em> quoting Erik Boasson)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>related to potential inconsistent systems and the advice to properly distinguish between unregistering (as an administrative task) and disposing (as a <em>data-lifecycle-management</em> task)</li>

<h5 id="remarks_11">remarks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>the fix addresses a <em>not-incorrect-yet-pretty-non-intuitive</em> behavior although it exploits vendor_id to select the correct/intuitive retransmit-behavior</li>

<h5 id="remarks_13">remarks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>note that its (still) invalid to assume that <em>instance_handle</em> obtained by <em>register_instance()</em> would be valid in a reader-context (also as that instance might not even have been written)</li>
<li>note also that a lot of this doesn't apply for built-in topics that although with similar API have vastly different implementation to 'manifest' actual instances of such 'pseudo-topics', at least as I understand it</li>
<li>the discussion also mentions equality of <em>same-keys-yet-in-different-topics</em> that would come-in 'handy' for equi-joins (i.e. multi-topics which would still be a nice and unique feature to have for Cyclone DDS)</li>

<h5 id="remarks_14">remarks:</h5>
<ul>
<li>it also implies a behavioral change where the parent of a participant is no longer <em>DDS_HANDLE_NIL</em> but instead a domain handle</li>
<li>and also impacts the behavior of 'implicit' entities (that are deleted automatically on deletion of the last remaining child entity)</li>

<li>noting that the source- and/or destination-oriented partitions are also patterns that work quite nice and imply unicast-traffic in those ‘dedicated’ partitions</li>
<li>also related to an IoT-concept of so-called <em>sourceContextFilters</em> on an input of an IoT 'Thing' that result in a subscription tied to a source-specific partition (in a usecase related to enforcing a point-to-point data-flow between an inference-engine and 'its' raw/to-be-processed sensor data)</li>

<li>anyhow, the ticket contains an elaborate overview on means/methods to measure latency and related jitter</li>
